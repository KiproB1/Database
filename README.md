# Database
Database week 2 assignment
Define what an attribute is in the context of a database:

An attribute in the context of a database refers to a specific piece of information or characteristic that describes an entity. Attributes represent properties, traits, or characteristics of the entity being modeled within the database schema. For example, in a database representing employees, attributes could include "EmployeeID," "FirstName," "LastName," "DateOfBirth," "Department," etc.
Why is it important to have a unique identifier for each item in a database?

Having a unique identifier for each item in a database is crucial for ensuring data integrity and facilitating efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Unique identifiers, such as primary keys, guarantee that each entity within the database is uniquely identifiable and distinguishable from others. This uniqueness prevents duplicate entries and ensures that each item can be referenced and manipulated accurately without ambiguity.
Provide at least five examples of attributes that might be associated with a "Patient" entity in a hospital database:

PatientID
FirstName
LastName
DateOfBirth
Gender
Address
ContactNumber
InsuranceProvider
MedicalHistory
Allergies
Imagine a library book. List three characteristics that help distinguish one specific book from another:

ISBN (International Standard Book Number)
Title
Author
Explain the difference between a single-valued attribute and a multi-valued attribute, providing an example of each:

Single-valued attribute: A single-valued attribute is an attribute that can hold only one value for a given entity instance. For example, in a database representing employees, the attribute "DateOfBirth" would typically be single-valued because each employee has only one date of birth.
Multi-valued attribute: A multi-valued attribute is an attribute that can hold multiple values for a given entity instance. For example, in a database representing employees, the attribute "Skills" could be multi-valued because an employee may possess multiple skills such as programming languages, soft skills, etc.
